# ZS6D

![teaser](./assets/overview.png)

We demonstrate the effectiveness of deep features extracted from self-supervised, pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) for Zero-shot 6D pose estimation. For more detailed information check out the corresponding [[paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.11986.pdf)].

## Installation:

### Docker setup:

### ROS integration:

## Template rendering:
To generate templates from a object model to perform inference, we refer to the [ZS6D_template_rendering](https://github.com/haberger/ZS6D_template_rendering) repository.

## Template preparation:

1. set up a config file for template preparation

```zs6d_configs/template_gt_preparation_configs/your_config.json```

2. Run the preparation script with your config_file to generate your_template_gt_file.json prepare template descriptors and template uv maps

```python3 prepare_templates_and_gt.py --config_file your_config.json```


## Inference:


## Evaluation on BOP Datasets:
